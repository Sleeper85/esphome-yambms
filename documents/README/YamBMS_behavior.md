## Shunt and BMS combination

### Combine status

**Combine Availability** : This status indicates whether the BMS or Shunt meets the conditions to be combined.

**Can be combined** : This status indicates whether the BMS or Shunt is currently combined.

## Shunt

Combine condition :
1) the `Combine` switch is enabled
2) the `Voltage` supplied by the shunt `is > 0V`

If one of these two conditions is not respected, the shunt is automatically decombined.

As soon as you import a `shunt` and it can be combined (see condition) the values ​​(Voltage, Current, Power and SoC) of the shunt(s) will take precedence over the BMS values.

## BMS

Combine condition :
1) the `Combine` switch is enabled
2) BMS `Charging` or `Discharging` switch is enabled
3) BMS is not in `alarm`

If one of these three conditions is not met, the BMS is automatically decombined.

## BMS alarms

The `errors_bitmask` values ​​are merged and then analyzed continuously **even if the BMS is uncombined**.

As long as at least one BMS is working normally the system will continue to work.
YamBMS will display BMS alarms as `Warning`.

If all BMS are in alarm, they are all uncombined and in this case the sending of instructions on the `CAN bus` is also stopped.
YamBMS will display BMS alarms as `Alarm`.

## CAN bus link

For the CAN bus link to be established with your inverter, the two conditions below must be met:
1) At least one BMS is in service (the number of combined BMS must be `> 0`)
2) Your inverter sends an `ACK 0x305` every `1s` (the link will be faulty if no ACK is received for 5s)

If these conditions are not met, the application waits `120s` before trying to connect again.
